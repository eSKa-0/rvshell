a python program to get acces to cmd on a remote/infected computer

usage:
  1.  open the dangerfile.pyw in an editor. (pyw is just a python file without a terminal opening)
  2.  change the SERVER_HOST variable to "{your ip adress}"
  3.  run the rvshell.py file.
  4.  afterwards you can run the dangerfile.pyw on your own machine to test.

note:
  You cannot change directories using this tool (i am looking for a way to do so).
  A python file will be published later on to write a .bat file to the startup directory to add to the dangerfile.pyw.
  Might try to convert it to an .exe.
